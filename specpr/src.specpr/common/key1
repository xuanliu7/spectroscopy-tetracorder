# alias (variables) in specpr series (inferred from code, R. Clark 2/2025)
#
# ikeywd  =  alias found on command line (? I think.  R. Clark))
# keysiz  =  the alias size
#  beg    =  beginning position on the command line where the vvariable should be put
# ibeg    =
# lnend   =
# nend    =
# set     =  seems to be a copy of iopcon (the command line)

# cmdals  =  the name of the cmd variable  (max 16 characters)
# cmdtrn  =  the value of the variable (max 75 characters)
# numals  =  the number of defined aliases (variables)
# trnsiz  =  the value of the variable size.
# alsize  =  the translated variable size.
# cmdcomm =  comment for the variable
# acomsiz =  comment length

# subroutines that use these arrays:
#
#  setkey      gets the alias definition from the command line
#                    this subroutine is called by crtn
#  setals      does the actual setting of the key; called by setkey
#  keytrn      translates an alias with its value on the command line
#                    this subroutine is called by crtn
#  allist      lists all the aliases (variables)

# be sure common/spmaxes is included in the code before this file
